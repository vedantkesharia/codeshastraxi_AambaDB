## 🚀 Project Overview

**AambaDB** is a comprehensive restaurant analytics and anomaly detection system designed to help restaurant owners and managers monitor, analyze, and optimize their business operations. The system leverages advanced machine learning algorithms, vector databases, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and interactive dashboards to provide real-time insights into restaurant performance, detect anomalies in sales patterns, and generate detailed analytical reports.

The platform also includes an **AI-powered incident resolution workflow using Zapier and Bland AI**, enabling restaurant owners to initiate automated AI voice calls to staff members directly from flagged transactions. The AI agent receives contextual information about the detected issue, explains the problematic entry, gathers additional information from the employee, records and transcribes the conversation, generates an AI-powered summary, and stores the transcript and summary in the database for the restaurant owner to review through the mobile application.

### 🎯 Problem Statement

Modern restaurants generate vast amounts of data from POS systems, sales transactions, inventory, and customer interactions. However, most establishments lack the tools to:

- **Detect anomalies** in sales patterns, pricing, or inventory
- **Analyze trends** and predict future performance
- **Generate insights** from unstructured data
- **Monitor staff performance** and identify irregularities
- **Create comprehensive reports** for decision-making

AambaDB addresses these challenges by providing an AI-powered analytics platform that transforms raw restaurant data into actionable insights.
